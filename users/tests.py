from django.test import TestCase

# Create your tests here.
# There are two ideal times to add tests: either before you write any code
# (test-drivendevelopment) or immediately after you’ve added new functionality
# and it’s clear in your mind.
# as a general rule,
# you do not need to add tests for core Django functionality
